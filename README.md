# Obliqo

> **An AI job platform that helps users apply less — and grow more.**

Obliqo is an AI-powered job matching platform that helps job seekers make **fewer, smarter applications** by providing intelligent job fit scoring, career-protective recommendations, and transparent AI explanations.

## 🎯 The Problem

Job seekers waste time applying blindly to low-quality, high-competition, or career-damaging roles. Existing platforms optimize for **application volume**, not **career outcomes**.

## ✅ Our Solution

Obliqo uses AI to:
- Match jobs semantically (not just keywords)
- Score job fit transparently (0-100%)
- Recommend Apply/Wait/Skip/Avoid decisions
- Detect ghost jobs and career risks
- Provide skill gap analysis and learning roadmaps
